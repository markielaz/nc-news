#reMARKable

We were challenged to complete a full stack React App from scratch - the only thing we were provided was the test data which we used to construct our own API using Heroku.

Our choice was between "Northcoders News" and "Northcoders Games" - both variants essentially functioned the same, just using different content. My version of NC News, called "reMARKable" is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

The site contains articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.

This app was created to help consolidate my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from both a front and back end perspective.

The back end was built first in a separate repo - here is the link to that for reference purposes: https://github.com/markielaz/be-project-nc-news

This project has been deployed on Netlify ready to check out in your browser as a fully responsive application - the link is available here: https://remarkable.netlify.app/

Should you wish to run the project locally, you will need to follow these instructions: 

- clone down the repo `git clone https://github.com/markielaz/reMARKable.git`
- navigate to the folder on your machine `cd reMARKable`
- open in your text editor of choice (I recommend VSCode) `code .`
- you will next need to install the dependencies `npm install`
- now you should be able to start the app using `npm start`
